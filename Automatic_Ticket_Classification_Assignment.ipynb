    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost  years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab  is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost   years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they would nt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there is nt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab   is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they would nt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there is nt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed  \n",

       "21   on xxxx  i made a  payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21   on xxxx   i made a   payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\n i contacted chase via a secured message on   explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient   that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team   i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and did nt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\n i called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\n when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\n during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a   fast safe and easy way to send money   but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21   on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and did nt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called xxxx who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "21   on    i made a   payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with  on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\n i contacted chase via a secured message on   explaining what happened and asked   is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at  that can give me more information about the recipient   that  my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that   the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team   i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call  and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at  and did nt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask  or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\n i called  who s automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called  again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\n when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact  to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\n during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a   fast safe and easy way to send money   but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost  years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab  is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost   years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they would nt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there is nt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab   is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with xxxx pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real xxxx xxxx chase bank told me they would nt even investigate report this to xxxx or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there is nt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the xxxx tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using xxxx on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using xxxx and xxxx integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with  pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost   years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real   chase bank told me they would nt even investigate report this to  or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there is nt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the  tab   is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using  on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using  and  integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",
